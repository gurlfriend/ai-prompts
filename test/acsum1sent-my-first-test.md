## Prompt used for this test
You are an assistant. Given a short abstract or paragraph, write one clear sentence that summarizes the main idea. Keep it under 20 words.

## Input
Paste the exact paragraph you gave the model (including quotes if you used them):

Input: "Genetic and stereotaxic approaches were used to refine cellular and anatomic targeting of DREADDs, restricting expression to orexin cells in the most caudal and lateral portions of the LH (Figure 1;20). Adult male orexin-cre (Cre) or wildtype (Wt) mice (n=3/group) received injections of a DREADD virus (hM3Dq) at one site per hemisphere aimed at caudal lateral LH (Figure 1b). Histological LH tissue analysis confirmed selective expression of hM3Dq-mCherry in orexin neurons (Figures 1c and f). Low magnification images capture nearly the entire orexin neuron field and show clear colocalization between immunoreactive channels labeling orexin (green) and hM3Dq-mCherry (red; Figure 1c). High magnification images show expected cytoplasmic labeling of mCherry and orexin (orange arrowheads, middle row; Figure 1c). mCherry staining was absent in Wt::hM3Dq controls (Figure 1e)."

## Expected output (example)
Targeted DREADD expression selectively labels orexin neurons in caudal lateral LH, confirmed by mCherry colocalization.
